This supplemental document provides the mathematical foundations, extended algorithmic descriptions, and detailed pseudocode underlying the learning–augmented CSP/SAT framework presented in the main paper.
It includes complete specifications of Algorithms 1–18, covering the ML and RL components used for propagation, decision making, conflict analysis, restart control, structural instance analysis, and
first-order CSP reasoning. The supplement further details the differentiable neural logic operators, reinforcement-learning update rules, graph-based representations, grounding procedures for FOL-CSPs,
and disjunctive programming formulations. Additional flowcharts, examples, and empirical summaries are provided to support and clarify the methods discussed in the main article, whose e-print is available at
